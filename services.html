    <P style="color:red">HTML Service: Create and Serve HTML bookmark_border The HTML service lets you serve web pages that can interact with server-side Apps Script functions. It is particularly useful for building web apps or adding custom user interfaces in Google Docs,
        Sheets, and Forms. You can even use it to generate the body of an email. Create HTML files New editor Legacy editor To add an HTML file to your Apps Script project, follow these steps: Open the Apps Script editor. At the left, click Add a file
        add > HTML. Within the HTML file, you can write most standard HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. The page will be served as HTML5, although some advanced features of HTML5 are not available, as explained in Restrictions. Your file can also
        include template scriptlets that are processed on the server before the page is sent to the user — similar to PHP — as explained in the section on templated HTML. Serve HTML as a web app To create a web app with the HTML service, your code must
        include a doGet() function that tells the script how to serve the page. The function must return an HtmlOutput object, as shown in this example. Code.gs Index.html function doGet() { return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('Index'); } Once
        that basic framework is in place, all you have to do is save a version of your script, then deploy your script as a web app. After the script is deployed as a web app, you can also choose to embed it in a Google Site</P>
